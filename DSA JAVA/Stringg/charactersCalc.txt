Calculating Next character of a Char:- (char) ('a' + ((ch - 'a') + 1) % 26)

ch - 'a': Gives 0 for 'a', 1 for 'b', ..., 25 for 'z'
+ 1: Shift to next character
% 26: To wrap around 'z' â†’ 'a'
'a' + ...: Convert back to character
(char): Final conversion to character


Another solution is with Bit manipulation, counting number of 1s
