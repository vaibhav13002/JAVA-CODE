Given n number of strings, replace T with S such that the string contains SOS in a recurring fashion.

In case the string does not contain recurring SOS then 0 should be returned else return the sum of the all the T's replaced across all 4 strings. Return the number of SOS in each string and the sum of the them as well.

 

I/P:

S = TOTSOS 

S = TOOSOT

S = SOSSOT

S = SSSOSS


O/P: 

String 1: 2

String 2: 0

String 3: 1

String 4: 0
